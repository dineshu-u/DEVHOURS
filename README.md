# 🚦 Flow Guardian X  
**Predictive Traffic Intelligence & Multi-Objective Optimization System**  
Domain: Intelligent Transportation Systems / Smart Cities / AI Optimization  

---

## 📌 Overview
Flow Guardian X is an AI-driven traffic management system designed to transform urban mobility from **reactive control** to **predictive intelligence**.  
It anticipates congestion, quantifies delays, detects bottlenecks, and dynamically optimizes routing while balancing **delay, emissions, and risk**.  

---

## 🎯 Motivation
Urban transportation networks face:
- Severe congestion  
- Increased travel time  
- High fuel consumption  
- Elevated emissions  
- Delayed emergency response  
- Economic productivity loss  

Traditional traffic systems rely on static signal timers and reactive logic.  
Flow Guardian X introduces **predictive optimization** for smarter cities.

## 🛠 Features
- **Delay Prediction** (regression models: Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- **Congestion Regime Detection** (Free Flow, Stable, Meta-Stable, Unstable, Gridlock Risk)  
- **Bottleneck Escalation Detection** (accidents, weather, signal cycle impact)  
- **Multi-Objective Route Optimization** (delay, emissions, risk trade-offs)  
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority Logic** (dynamic weight switching, green wave activation)  
- **Simulation Environment** (synthetic traffic scenarios for testing)  
- **Dashboard & API** (real-time visualization and REST endpoints)
